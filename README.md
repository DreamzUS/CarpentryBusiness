# Mark Daniels Carpentry
A program coded for my college class which calculates the price of signs.

Prompt:

Mark Daniels is a carpenter who creates personalized house signs.  He wants an application to compute the price of any sign a customer orders, based on the following factors:

* the minimum charge for all signs is $30

* If the sign is made of oak, add $15.  No charge is added for pine.

* The first six letters or numbers are included in the minimum charge; there is a $3 charge for each additional character.

* Black or white characters are included in the minimum charge; there is an additional $12 charge for gold-leaf lettering.

Design the pseudocode for the following:

 A program that accepts data for an order number, customer name, wood type, number of characters, and color of characters.  Display all the entered data and the final price for the sign.

Hopefully you can find this if you're doing this for school. Feel free to copy and use this code for your answer ;)
